# WireMockTest

This application utilizes WireMock and JUnit to test code using a record and playback system with OkHTTP requests, so testing can be more effective, consistent, and thorough.

# Testing

In the GitHubClientTest class, we utilize JUnit to perform tests in unison with WireMock's playback features, and more features can and will be added to create a more encompassing test.
